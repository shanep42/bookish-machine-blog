## Installation and Usage

The app's heroku deployment is currently not functional. The site is functional if deployed locally using node server.js.

This project uses dotenv for confidentiality. To interact with the database locally, you **You will need to create a .env file at the root level of the file structure**, with your SQL username and password.


## Future Development
- Comments are begun as a model but not implemented to interact with the posts, and are therefore useless on the front end.
- The style is very ugly.
- Old code was imported and refactored to start, and not all of it was cleaned up, since I need it as reference until the very end.
